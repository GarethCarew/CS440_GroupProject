# CS440 To-Do List Group Project
This project is a website based to-do list that uses a login system to save individual lists to a database backend. This setup allows for each user to have a customized experience with their specific lists to show to only them. Once taken to the website, a login prompt will require a username and password. After a successful login, users will be greeted with
a page that will present their already existing to-do list with some different inclusions.

These inclusions are:
- a text input for adding new items to the list
- a button to allow modifying existing items
- a button for deleting pre-existing items

Some information to still work on is:
- [ ] Including a working code for the [style.css](https://github.com/GarethCarew/CS440_GroupProject/blob/main/public/stylesheets/style.css)
- [ ] Commit the different UML Diagrams to the GitHub
- [ ] Create a prototype video to include
